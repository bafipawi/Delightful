## Getting Started

Run the following commands to get started:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jsealey/Delightful.git

Now open the Xcode project and build.

Need help? Email <jsealey762@gmail.com> or open an issue with specifics.


## Why is this open source?

This is open source since the app is going to be free anyway. It is intended to be a source of sample code for everyone to benefit from. You can make cool apps that use code from Delightful and I hopefully get more users because you built something awesome.

Also, if you want to help out and fix some bugs, I'll really appreciate it. Maybe you'll even learn something :)
